    "description": "A library for interfacing Arduino with the C/MRI computer control system for model railroads. This library allows you to easily interface your Arduino with JMRI (Java Model Railroad Interface) by emulating Bruce Chubb's Computer/Model Railroad Interface (C/MRI) System. It provides a simple API to handle GET, SET, and POLL requests from JMRI automatically, with support for up to 2048 digital lines.",
